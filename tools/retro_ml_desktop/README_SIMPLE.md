# Retro ML Desktop - Simple Process Manager

A **much simpler** CustomTkinter desktop application that runs your existing ML training scripts directly as Python processes. **No Docker required!**

## Why This Is Better

‚úÖ **No Docker complexity** - Uses your existing Python environment  
‚úÖ **Direct process control** - Runs `training/train.py` directly  
‚úÖ **Simpler setup** - Just install Python dependencies  
‚úÖ **Better performance** - No container overhead  
‚úÖ **Easier debugging** - Direct access to Python processes  
‚úÖ **Works immediately** - Uses your existing training pipeline

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r tools/retro_ml_desktop/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
python -m tools.retro_ml_desktop.main_simple
```

That's it! No Docker, no containers, no complexity.

## How It Works

The application directly runs your existing `training/train.py` script as Python subprocesses with:

- **Resource Control**: CPU core affinity, memory monitoring, GPU selection
- **Process Management**: Start, stop, remove training processes
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time system metrics and process status

| **Resource Usage** | Higher memory usage              | Lower memory usage        |
| **Complexity**     | High (images, volumes, networks) | Low (just processes)      |
| **Startup Time**   | Slower (container creation)      | Faster (direct execution) |
| **File Access**    | Volume mounts required           | Direct file system access |

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** with your existing ML environment
- **NVIDIA GPU** (optional, for GPU training)
- **Windows/Linux/macOS** (cross-platform)

## Troubleshooting

### "Training script not found"

- Ensure you're running from the project root
- Check that `training/train.py` exists

### "Failed to start training process"

- Check that your Python environment has all ML dependencies
- Verify the training script works manually
- Check available system resources

### GPU not detected

- Install GPU monitoring: `pip install nvidia-ml-py GPUtil`
- Check GPU availability: `nvidia-smi`
- Use CPU-only training (set GPU to "none")

### Process won't stop

- Use "Remove Selected" to remove stuck processes
- Check Task Manager for orphaned Python processes
