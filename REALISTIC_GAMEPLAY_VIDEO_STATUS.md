## Expected Outcomes

### Video Content

- **Hour 1 (0-15 min)**: Mostly random play, low scores, frequent ball loss
- **Hour 2 (15-30 min)**: Improving paddle control, occasional brick hits
- **Hour 3 (30-45 min)**: Strategic positioning, consistent brick destruction
- **Hour 4 (45-60 min)**: Skilled play, higher scores, longer rallies

### Learning Demonstration

- **Skill progression**: 0% → 80% skill level over 60 minutes
- **Score improvement**: Low initial scores → progressively higher scores
- **Episode length**: Short episodes → longer, more strategic gameplay
- **Success rate**: Increasing brick destruction and ball control
